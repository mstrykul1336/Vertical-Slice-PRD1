What was done: 
- 
To do:
- Get abilities added and working, with basic UI during the night phase. Each role should get a different ability and some abilities should change based on the alignment. 
- Fix attack, but since attack will be replaced with abilities, it's not a huge deal. 
- Fix time between winning and losing, adding in a UI screen or separate scene that plays a temporary UI to show what side and what players on that side won.
- Fill shop with more items (I think I want to have 3 total):
      -  Potion of Life: Restore one heart (max 2 per player, single use)

      - Shield: Wear for a night to prevent an attack (max 1 per player, single use, only use at night)
    - Cthulhu's knife: Deal an extra half heart damage with an attack (max 1, single use, only use at night)

- Make it so you can actually use items in your inventory and lose the item after using it. 
-Need UI for half a heart and 1/4 of a heart because abilities add this in. 
- Change assassin role name to just detective (can be a bad detective) 
- Get neutral alignment in the game, just for if the old man is there. Also add in the win condition if the old man is killed or voted out, they win.
- Add options to the main menu to include: "Controls", "Roles + Abilities" and possibly sound control. 
- Additionally, I need to figure out why it randomly will set health wrong and sometimes set it right. Also including why sometimes it properly disconnects a player and sometimes it doesn't. 
Backlog:

- For more variety, I want some of the roles to have special passives. Such as the medic is immune to bleeding or poison and the Clairvoyant is immune to dying at night (must be voted out).
- Eventually implement voice chat (photon has apparently a plugin for this). 
- Add in characters and assign them randomly to players. Give the buff that each character gives to players and make a temporary UI for what that looks like. (Later on, that white box will be the player's character icon). I am still debating this as it is might just be feature creep. For this one, I don't think I am going to worry about adding characters unless I have extra time.
